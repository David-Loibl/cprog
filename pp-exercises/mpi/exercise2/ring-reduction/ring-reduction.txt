Exercise - global and partial sums 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rewrite the pass-around-the-ring program to perform its global sums by
  using MPI global reduction (instead of passing around rank values).
  
- Then rewrite it so that each process computes a partial sum.

- Then rewrite this so that each process prints out its partial result,
  in the correct order (process 0, then process 1, etc.).

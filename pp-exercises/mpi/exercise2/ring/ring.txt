Exercise: Rotating information around a ring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A set of processes are arranged in a ring.

- Each process stores its rank in MPI_COMM_WORLD in an integer.

- Each process passes this on to its neighbour on the right.

- Keep passing what is received until the own rank is back where it started.

- Each processor calculates the sum of the values.

Exercise - Derived datatypes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Modify the passing-around-a-ring exercise.

- Calculate two separate sums:

 	. rank integer sum, as before
 	. rank floating point sum

- Use a struct (C) or type (Fortran) datatype for this.

- Extra task: Instead of passing around the ring use global reduction
  and a user-defined function for the sum of the struct.
  Use hints.c or hints.f90 respectively.
